### create_folders_by_filename.py

This script will create multiple directories named after a portion of the input file name.

**Example**: Your input is one folder location with files readme1.txt, readme2.txt, readme3.txt. The output will be 3 folders called 1, 2, and 3 that correspond to the number after 'readme' in each file. Those are the unique characters chosen from the filename to carry to the folder name.
