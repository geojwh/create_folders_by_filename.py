# create_folders_by_filename.py
This script will create multiple directories named after a portion of the input file name.

Example: input is one folder location with files readme1.txt, readme2.txt, readme3.txt. Output is 3 folders called 1, 2, and 3 that correspond to the number after readme in each file because those are the unique characters chosen from the filename.
